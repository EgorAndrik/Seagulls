<h2 align="center">Hackathon Challenge: Seagulls</h2>

> Utashud Island, part of the South Kamchatka Federal Reserve, lies 4 kilometers from the Pacific coast of Kamchatka in Vestnik Bay. Sea otters, anthurs, spotted seals, about 50,000 birds of ten different species live on it, including a colony of 10,000 hatchet pairs. At the hackathon, we are interested in two inhabitants of the island - spotted seal and techno-ocean gull, which are monitored through camera traps in the summer season.

> On Utashuda there is a reproductive rookery of spotted seals and one of the largest settlements of the slaty-backed gull in Kamchatka (4 thousand pairs). For 1 season of observing these animals, more than 1800 photographs of various quality can be accumulated. Through these photographs, inspectors assess the welfare and abundance of animals.

> Develop an algorithm to count seagulls that are larger than 5x5 pixels in a photograph and help the researchers.
